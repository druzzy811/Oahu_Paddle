               Drew Burrier holds a Master's Degree in Marine Science with a concentration in physical oceanography from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, where he delved deep into the mysteries of the ocean's movements and its intricate relationship with the broader Earth system. Transitioning from academia to practical application, Drew has applied his vast knowledge and analytical skills as a data scientist and engineer. His work spans a variety of challenging environments: numerical weather simulation, environmental protection, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. 

               Living in Honolulu, Drew is immersed in his passions: the sea, an analytical and creative approach to the world, and the serene beauty of island life. With his unique background in marine science and expertise in data science and engineering, Drew is excited to apply his technical and scientific skillset to this new adventure in creative expression. When he's not immersed in data or exploring the depths of the ocean, Drew enjoys skiing, surfing, hiking, and sucking the marrow out of life.
